Biography:

     My name is Jonathan. I am a 27 year old student at Southern New Hampshire University pursuing my Bachelors in Game Programming and Development. I am relatively new to coding, but am teaching myself as I go, as well as what the school teaches me. My hopes are to work with Blizzard Entertainment, Treyarch Games, Bethesda, Ubisoft, Bungie, just to name a few choice studios. I, at one point, was able to create an android app using android studio, but because of my lack of knowledge in java and others, I tried to fix one thing, and messed up the entire project. My hopes are to be able to create amazing apps, websites, and games with what I learn thru SNHU.
